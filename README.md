# VRM
Implementation of Virtual and Real Machines (OS course assignment #2)

## Code rules:
- Project uses Java 8 (lambdas, etc.)
- Everything (comments, ids, variable names, etc.) are in ENGLISH
- Typical java code rules
 - Class names start with capitals and are CamelCased = *SomeClass*
 - File names are underscore separated = *hello_world.java*
 - Constants (static final) = uppercase, underscore = *SOME_CONSTANT*
 - Variables are CamelCased = *someVariable*
- Indentation = 2 spaces (not tab)
- All commited and pushed code MUST compile. If you're not finished - don't mislead others.
- Keep the code as clean as possible
- If it's hard - simplify it
- If it takes time to understand - comment it
